### Project description:

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

#### Milestone 1
A task to set up gitHub for this task and ensure the local and remote versions of these repos are up-to-date.

#### Milestone 2
How to use the .random function with a [list] of words that I've defined. Ask the user for an input, checking that the input is a single character.

#### Milestone 3
Iteratively check if the guess is valid, using a **while** loop. If the guess is valid use **break** and, if not, print an error message. If the code is a mess, define functions to help but be careful with the order of functions, calling one function in another to make sure they both run.
